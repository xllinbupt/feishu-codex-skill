## What This Skill Covers

- Plain text, post, and forwarded message parsing
- Streamed replies through in-place Feishu message edits
- Per-chat session continuity with `session_key -> codex_session_id`
- Switching a Feishu chat back to saved local Codex sessions
- Merge windows, per-chat queues, and workdir synchronization
- ACLs, rate limits, and raw-command hardening

## Repository Layout

- `SKILL.md`: main skill instructions and trigger description
